# AutoCompleteTextIdeaFlow

**Release Notes**

	1. MVVM Architecture Implementation
 			•The project is now structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
	2. ViewController Responsibilities
 
		•The ViewController handles the addition of the TextView, text changes, and appending the suggestions view (AutoCompleteView).
	3. AutoCompleteView Implementation
 
		•Suggestions are displayed in a TableView within the AutoCompleteView.
		•The AutoCompleteView is added independently, allowing it to be replaced with other views without modifying the ViewController.

		•Introduced AutocompleteViewModelProtocol and AutocompleteViewModel.
		•These components manage business logic and provide the necessary suggestions to the ViewController.
	5. Enums and Structs
 
		•Enums and structs have been created for flexible handling of various components and data.
	6. UITextView and Delegate Methods
 
		•Used UITextView and its delegate methods to detect and handle text input.
	7. Ease of Understanding and Modification
